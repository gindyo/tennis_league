Sportmanship rules: 
 - to encurage people to be honest you will not be able to see your own sportmanship score
 - if you collect enough whiner or cheeter ponts people can deny your requests for matches without penalty.
 - to prevent people from abusing the complaints system with every complaint your complaint power will
   decrease.
 - every good rep will increase your complaint power 
 - be as honest as possible because giving too much praise to your opponent can hurt you if he decides to give
  you a bad rep.
